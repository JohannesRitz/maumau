maumau
======

A basic version of the game "maumau" to be played on the command line, as exercise to learn both python and github.

MauMau is played the following way:
 * You initially draw 6 cards. (This amount might vary.)
 * If its your turn, you can play a card, if it matches the current card's color or value.
 * If you cannot play a card, you must draw a card.
 * You win if you have no card left on your hand.
Special Card Effects:
 * 8: The next player must pause.
 * 7: The next player must draw 2 cards, unless he can play another 7. The next player must draw 4 cards, if he cannot play a 7 and so on.

TODO:
 * Nicer output (more explicit text, better format and timing)
 * Interactive player management -> This is currently hard coded
 * GUI ?
